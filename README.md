# HeyPhineas
HeyPhineas is my final year programming course project.

Ran on Flask, HeyPhineas is a user interface for a suggestion algorithm that groups people together and suggests a location to go to.


HeyPhineas is a unique social network application, aimed at connecting friends with mutual interests and geographical proximity. The application integrates a K-Means algorithm to compute the best location to meet, taking into consideration close-by relevant activities. HeyPhineas uses a K-means implementation along with KNN, to classify a type of activity for a group of people and makes use of Google Maps API to draw a route and apply directions. It also employs an online database of thousands of locations (parks, restaurants, etc.) and traffic data to generate the optimal route for the user.

The name HeyPhineas, comes from the popular TV-show Phineas and Ferb. In the show, the main character Phineas tells ferb in the beginning of each episode: “Ferb, I know what we’re going to to today!”. Drawing inspiration from this, I envisioned the user as Ferb, asking: “Hey Phineas, what will we be doing today?” – Thus, HeyPhineas.
